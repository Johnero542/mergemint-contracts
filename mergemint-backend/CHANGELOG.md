# MergeMint Backend API Changelog

All notable changes to the `/api/tx/*` routes and the broader backend API are
documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `GET /api/v1/bounties/assignee/{address}` — paginated list of bounties where
  `address` is recorded as an assignee in the `assignees` join table. Symmetric
  counterpart to the existing `bounties_by_creator` query. (#481)
- `GET /api/v1/bounties/stream` — Server-Sent Events channel that broadcasts a
  bounty ID whenever `refresh_bounty` completes in the indexer. Clients receive
  `bounty_updated` events without polling. (#482)

### Changed
- All stable endpoints now live under the `/api/v1/` prefix. Unprefixed
  `/api/*` paths remain as deprecated aliases and will be removed in a future
  minor release. (#483)
